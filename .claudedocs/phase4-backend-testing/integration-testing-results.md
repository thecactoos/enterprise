## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. API Gateway Compilation Errors ⚠️ **NON-CRITICAL**
**Issue**: TypeScript compilation errors in health service
**Impact**: API Gateway routing affected
**Workaround**: Direct service access functional
**Priority**: Medium (frontend integration blocked)

### 2. Customer Validation Dependency ⚠️ **MANAGEABLE**
**Issue**: Invoice service validates customers via Contacts Service
**Impact**: Requires existing contacts for invoice creation
**Workaround**: Can disable validation with `validateCustomer: false`
**Priority**: Low (business logic working as designed)

## Recommendations for Production Deployment

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix API Gateway**: Resolve TypeScript compilation errors
2. **Health Checks**: Add health check endpoints to all services
3. **Error Handling**: Implement graceful degradation for service dependencies

### Production Readiness Checklist
- ✅ Database schema migrated
- ✅ Polish VAT compliance implemented
- ✅ Advanced pricing calculations working
- ✅ Invoice generation functional
- ⚠️ API Gateway needs fixing
- ⚠️ Frontend integration pending
- ⚠️ End-to-end testing incomplete
