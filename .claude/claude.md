## Tool Usage Guidelines

### Web Search (WebSearch, WebFetch)
- **Purpose**: Research current best practices, documentation, and solutions
- **Usage**: Verify information, find examples, check compatibility

### Artifacts Management
- **Code Artifacts**: Store in `artifacts/code/` with appropriate subdirectory
- **Documents**: Technical reports, specifications in `artifacts/documents/`
- **Visualizations**: Diagrams, charts, presentations in `artifacts/visualizations/`
- **Exports**: Final deliverables and distributions in `artifacts/exports/`
- **Version Control**: Maintain artifact versioning with timestamps and descriptions

## File Management Protocols

### Naming Conventions
- **Timestamps**: ISO 8601 format (2025-07-30T15:30:00)
- **Versions**: Semantic versioning (v1.2.3) or sequential (v001, v002)
- **Categories**: Prefix with category (analysis_*, design_*, implementation_*)
- **Languages**: Suffix with language code for multilingual content (_en, _pl)

### Organization Structure
